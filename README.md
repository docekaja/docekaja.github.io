## Hello World

Hi there! I am a Junior JavaScript/TypeScript developer who previously worked as a lawyer. However, after finding my passion for coding, I decided to take a leap of faith and enrolled in Green Fox Academy's bootcamp to become a software developer.

[On this page](https://docekaja.github.io/), you'll find some of my latest projects and skills, as well as a bit of information about me.

If you're interested in working together or have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me at [docekal26@gmail.com](mailto:docekal26@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub]). Thank you for visiting my portfolio!
